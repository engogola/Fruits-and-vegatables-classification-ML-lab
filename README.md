# Fruits-and-vegatables-classification-ML-lab
This was  a Lab project for the Unit for Machine Learning and AI for our fifth year sem 1,This was a gruop work.
In this note book we are to build a Machine learning model to predict between fruits and vegetables using tensoflow.The members of the lab group are

The following is a step by step guide on how we are going to achieve our experiment.

Importing libraries;The code starts by importing necesaary libraries in python as well as the starndadrd libraries.

Dataset paths;Specify the main path to the fruit dataset i.e training_folder and test_folder

Data augmentation and normalization. Data preprocessing ;define constants for batch size,image size and epochs.

Model Architecture

Training the model

Evaluating the model's perfomance

Visualizing the model's perfomance

saving the model

Prediction on random test images.

The data to this training were obtained in Nyeri town Market and some on Naivas Supermarket nyeri branch. Heres the link to the dataset "https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1OAWtMJs18qwzBkSzgasdJQ0Cu4SvyFJu?usp=drive_link
